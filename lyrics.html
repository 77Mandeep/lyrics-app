            Can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Hey!)
            I know the answers from the words of the prophet
            I've seen the light through the fingers, made of magic
            I've seen an image of the future, it's a vision
            And I know who you are, yeah!
            Go away can't you see you're not real
            Open your eye some place far away (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Hey!)
            I met a poet tonight behind the masses
            I sang a song about my many true addictions
            I saw myself in a hole, down below
            And I know who you are, yeah!
            I'm alright though it's hard to feel
            Open your eye some place far away
            I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
            I've got my wings and I'm startin' to fly (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Hey!)
            Open your eye, look to the sky
            Grab your wings and start to fly
            Open your eye, look to the sky
            Grab your wings and start to fly, hey!
            I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
            I've got my wings and I'm startin' to fly
            I've seen the ocean and I've seen the sky
            I've got my wings and I'm startin' to fly, yeah!
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Whoa, I'm startin' to fly) (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Yeah, I'm startin' to fly) (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Whoa, I'm startin' to fly) (Hey!)
            How high can we go?
            How high can we go? (Yeah, I'm startin' to fly) (Hey!)
